# Bio Neuralnet Evolution
An old project of mine and my brother's implemented in C++.

Original project: [bio-neuralnel-evolution](https://github.com/flexflower/bio-neuralnet-evolution)

Check out [David R. Miller](https://github.com/davidrmiller) whose similar project [biosim4](https://github.com/davidrmiller/biosim4) greatly helped me during development.

## Compiling
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
```
g++ src/temprule.cpp -o <out>.exe
```
